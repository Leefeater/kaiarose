  	  <p>Kaia was born on September the 16th, 2014. She has always been an active personality and loves meeting new people.<br>
      She loves playing with my toys everyday.  Her favorite one is a train that plays music! She really likes it when her daddy puts her on it and drives her around and around!
	  <br>
      Speaking of music Kaia loves it!  Her mommy plays her music out of the phone and she takes it away from Mom, dances around the room and sings along!  Her favorite song goes "I really, really, really, really, really, really like you!"
      <br>
      Her favote color is green!  She loves to eat Brocholi, Chicken, Shepards Pie, Bread and my other assorted delectables. Every morning when she awakes she wakes her mother and father up with a kiss.

    <h3>Animal Rights Activist</h3>
    <img class="w3-card-8" src="img/animal-img1.jpg">
    <p>Animal rights is a big problem in today's society. Too many dogs, and cats are very mistreated by their owners, leaving them harmed, neglected or homeless.  This doesn't get enough attention from the authorities, and it goes on unchecked.</p>
    <p>Kaia is an animal lover.  She always her parents know when one is around. She frequenly visits the under-priviliged animals at the shelter just to give them some love and attention. She has held events with other babies to present to them the importance of taking care of animals, as she believes that they have a right to a good life.</p>
